We are conveniently located on the corner of Perkiomen Avenue and 22nd Street and have our own well lit off street parking lot. The Suburban has been family owned and operated since 1954. Since June of 2003 Gary Poltonowicz and Mary Miller have been welcoming patrons and strive to maintain that family feel.

Black Angus burger or Boneless Grilled Chicken Breast.
